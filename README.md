Ngambang is a dummy Text Editor that saves `txt` file, along with a bunch of it's authors name. The file structure is highly inspired from Microsoft Office's `.*x` files. Microsoft uses `zip` file structure to save and maintains the document structure in a file. Anything, like Picture, Document Text, even the smallest detail like Authors and such more are saved in a file, inside those `.*x` files.

Ngambang is actually an assignment for my Operating System class, Lectured by Pa [Elisati H.](http://informatika.unpar.ac.id/dosen/elisatih/). Deadlined on 1st April, made with Java language, must highly use Threading.
